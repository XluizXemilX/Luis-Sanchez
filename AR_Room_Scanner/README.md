# ar_sketcher

A new Flutter application.

## Intro

This is an AR phone application that will use the camera and user interaction to take the measurements of
a room and generate a floor plan with all the detailed measurements of the room. It will also save the plans
for the user that way they can always have this information in hand when they need it without the use of a
measuring tape or getting the actual plans of the house.

## Required Spec

With the AR Room Designer, it will require the phoneâ€™s rear camera, the phone to have OpenGL ES installed,
have Android 7.0 or newer or have IOS 11.0 or newer, and have ARKit-compatibility or ARcore-compatibility.

## Function
The main function of this app is to get measurements of a room and create a floor plan based on the
measurements gotten from using the AR aspect. With the floor plan, the user will be able to get measurements
of their room, test fit furniture in the app's floor plan, and view and edit details about each aspect.
Along with the floor plan creation, there will be a way to add individual objects to view and place in floor plans.
